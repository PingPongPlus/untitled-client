/**
 * Automatically aims at one nearby entity and attacks when the normal cooldown is ready.
 *
 * Two separate update paths are intentional:
 * - tick() selects targets and attempts attacks at the client's game-tick rate.
 * - frame() eases the visible camera toward the target every rendered frame.
 * This keeps attack decisions tied to game ticks while making aiming smoother than
 * moving the camera only 20 times per second. Both callbacks run on the client thread,
 * so these shared fields do not need locks. This class does not rotate the camera secretly
 * or extend the player's normal attack reach.
